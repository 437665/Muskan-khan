    <p>the meaning of reproduction is the biological system to generate new offspring to grow the species that helps to make sure that they have enough species present. If we talk about queen parrotfish, reproduction contains specific behaviors that help them to produce and grow new children of parrotfish.
         Here's some explanation that how reproduction works in queen parrotfish: <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Life History:<br>Queen parrotfish normally spawn during their third year; reproduction takes place at Spawning Aggregations, where adults congregate at numerous sites on their coral reef to release their eggs and sperm at the same time. You can read more about spawning aggregations here. </li>
            <br>
            <li>
             Synchronous Spawning:<br> Most of the Queen Parrotfish Have babies at the same time the reason behind this is that they all fishes are born at the same time. This happens because there reproduction cycle depends on some environmental factors like moon, water temprature, and some other factors. because this lead into the more egg fertility and increased life span of their babies.
           
            </li><br>
            <li>External Fertilization:<br> their reproduction is called external reproduction because they are having babies outside their body. when femail queenparrotfish ready to have babies then they release theri eggs in the water and simultaneously male parrotfish release sperm. By meeting these eggs and sperms, fertilization happens in the water. these sperm fertilized in the water not in the body of female.
                After this, baby developed from the eggs while floating in water.</li><br>
            <li>Pelgic Larvel Level:<br> The fertilized eggs develop into larvae, which are small baby fish. These tiny larvae float in the ocean, they flow with the water in which direction water goes. With the help of this, they can migrate from their birthplace to another.  They are fighting with each other to get enough food. Additionally, it helps maintain gene diversity, which is advantageous to population health.
                 As a result of this, they travel around as little fish until they choose a new location and grow.</li>  <br>
         <li>Settlement and Metamorphosis:<br>When the small baby fish, are ready to develop into bigger they select a suitable area for their home. This might take place on rocks or chunks of cracked reefs on the water floor. After they've picked a location, they begin to alter.
             Metamorphosis is the term for this modification, which symbolizes a significant metamorphosis. Their bodies experience major internal and external adaptations. They begin to resemble young fish that are somewhat larger than larvae, known as young fish. These modifications aid in their adaptation to life on the ocean floor, where they will get nutrition and grow into adult fish.
         </li><br>
         <li>Adult Life stage:<br>The young fish, start living on the coral reefs as they are turning into adults after that, they will find a suitable place to live. They grow into adults as they mature. When they reach adulthood, they are ready to have a family of their own. It also means that they may participate in large events with other adult fish when they release sperm and eggs to create more baby fish.
             They help the cycle of spawning young fish and keeping up the population by doing this.</li><br>
             <li>Parental Care:<br>Many other fish, queen parrotfish do not feed their young. The parents do not stay to care for the eggs once they have been fertilized by releasing their eggs and sperm into the sea. The eggs and young fish are allowed to grow and succeed in the water on their own. After birth, kids get no help from their parents.</li><br>
